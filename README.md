I'm a software engineer focused on building reliable systems — from frontend interfaces to backend services and infrastructure.  
I value clarity, performance, and design that gets out of the way.

### Work & Interests
- Building **Insight Loop** – an AI-powered customer feedback intelligence platform.
- Exploring **DevOps**, infrastructure reliability, and scalable deployment patterns.
- Interested in **LLM inference efficiency**, distributed processing, and hybrid cloud setups.

### Skills

**Product & Frontend**
- Next.js with React
- Tailwind for clean systemized UI
- State management with Zustand

**Backend & Systems**
- Go and Node.js
- MongoDB / PostgreSQL
- REST and streaming architectures

**Infrastructure & Observability**
- Docker, Kubernetes
- GitHub Actions, CI/CD pipelines
- Prometheus, Grafana

**AI / Model Workflows**
- LLM inference (Gemma, Qwen, Ollama)
- Prompt-structured pipelines
- Vector search & embeddings

### Selected Projects
| Project | Description | Stack |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Insight Loop** | End-to-end platform to analyze customer feedback using AI | Go, MongoDB, Next.js, Ollama, Redis, Docker |
| Model Runtime Experiments | Efficiency testing with quantization formats & local inference | Gemma, Qwen, Metal (M1), Model Runner |

### How I Work
- Prefer **incremental iteration** over big rewrites.
- Optimize for **understandability**, not cleverness.
- Systems should be **simple to debug** and **boring by default**.
